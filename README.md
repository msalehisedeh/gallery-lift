# Welcome to gallery lift!

Have you ever wanted a gallery view that can display images and videos the way you want it? gallery lift is a configurable tool that allows you to pick and choose how your gallery is displayed.

**NOTE:** Added  `appRootName` attribute for ADA compliancy to be used for turning off all key actions when lift modal view is displayed. Default value for `appRootName` is `app-root`. When the modal gallery lift is created, it will be pushed in root body tag siblling to the angualr app root. If you are using a different tag name other than `app-root`, you should pass it to gallery-lift component.
